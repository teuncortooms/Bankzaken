# Bankzaken

This web app allows you to track your bank transactions in a Google Spreadsheet. You import a .csv file, the app checks for duplicate entries, and copies only new unique entries to the sheet. It also labels transactions based on search terms that you can set in the auto-generated Settings tab of the spreadsheet.
